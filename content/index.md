## Overview

This curricula resource provides material for teaching accessibility, and for reviewing accessibility courses. You can use it to develop robust digital accessibility courses. You can use it to include shorter accessibility topics in other courses, such as programming or graphics design.

You can also use this resource to evaluate existing or proposed courses.

This resource includes modules that cover accessibility foundations that apply broadly, and modules specific to developing, designing, and content authoring. The Foundation and Developer modules are available now. The Designer and Author modules will be available in 2021.

## How to Use This Resource

This resource is designed as a framework for instructors to build their own courses; or, for evaluating courses. It provides guidance and encourages customization based on specific situations. For example, teaching accessibility to computer science students could involve foundation, developer, and designer modules. Assessing the accessibility knowledge of front-end developers could involve foundation and developer modules. This resource suggests learning outcomes for each module. Yet, it does not prescribe duration, effort, or accreditation.

This resource is designed for a wide range of situations. For example:

* **faculty lecturer** &mdash; to teach computer science students about accessibility
* **accessibility professional** &mdash; to create a series of digital accessibility training courses
* **employee training coordinator** &mdash; to compare course content offered by different providers
* **procurer** &mdash; to include requirements in a training Request for Proposals (RFP)
* **hiring manager** &mdash; to compare competencies assessed for different certificates


## Structure and Terminology

Each part of this curricula (Foundation, Developer, Designer, Author) has:

* **Prerequisites** &mdash; Competencies expected for students to have previously acquired.
* **Modules** &mdash; Designed to be taught and assessed in their entirety.  
Each module consists of:
  * **Learning Outcomes for Module** &mdash; What students will learn and should be able to demonstrate.
  * **Competencies** &mdash; Skills required for students and instructors to teach the curriculum.
  * **Topics to Teach** &mdash; Recommended themes, to be taught in any order.  
  Each topic consists of:
    * **Learning Outcomes for Topic** &mdash; Detailed description of what students will learn and should be able to demonstrate.
    * **Teaching Ideas for Topic** &mdash; Suggested ideas to help instructors teach the learning outcomes based on topic contents.
    * **Ideas to assess knowledge for Topic** &mdash; Suggested ideas to assess the acquired skills or knowledge based on topic contents.
  * **Ideas to Assess Knowledge for Module** &mdash; Suggested ideas to assess the acquired skills or knowledge based on module contents.
  * **Teaching Resources** &mdash; Resources to help teach the learning outcomes. Some resources are integral part of the teaching while others are optional further reading.

Terminology specifically related to people with disabilities, assistive technologies, and adaptive strategies is provided in [How People with Disabilities Use the Web](/people-use-web).

## Tips

The following tips help you provide more effective courses, training, and certification programs on accessibility:
* **Involve people with disabilities** &mdash; Involve people with disabilities in courses so that students get perspectives from real people on the  impact of accessibility barriers and accessibility features. Invite people with disabilities to show how they use assistive technologies and adaptive strategies, the accessibility features they rely on, and barriers they encounter. If you cannot invite people with disabilities, consider using videos instead. Yet make sure to guide your students through the process to avoid perpetuating existing misunderstandings. For guidance on working with people with disabilities, ethical considerations, and cautions, see [Involving Users in Web Projects for Better, Easier Accessibility](/planning/involving-users/).
* **Include the reasons for accessibility features** &mdash; Include the *why*, not just the *how*. For example, students should know why to provide alternative text, not just how to. When students understand the reasons behind accessibility features and how people with disabilities use them, then students can implement more effective accessibility.
* **Cover all disabilities** &mdash; Avoid inadvertently prioritizing some types of disabilities over others. For guidance on cross-disability aspects, see [How People with Disabilities Use the Web](/people-use-web).
* **Explain roles and responsibilities** &mdash; Ensure that students understand the relationships between different roles (for example, developer, designer, writer), and the implications on different tasks.
* **Communicate the broader impact of accessibility** &mdash; Explain that accessibility needs to be implemented and sustained throughout the design and development processes, just as any other discipline. Communicate that accessibility  features often have a positive impact on other disciplines, such as usability or inclusive design. For references about how accessibility overlaps with other disciplines, see [Accessibility, Usability, and Inclusion](/fundamentals/accessibility-usability-inclusion/).
* **Make it accessible** &mdash; Ensure that the course itself is accessible. For example:
   * all presentations, teaching materials, exercises, assessments, and other student interactions are accessible
   * the online learning platform, the classroom, computer lab, and training venue are accessible
   * captions, sign-language, and large-print is provided when needed
   * instructors describe visual information, including text on the screen

   For specific guidance, see [How to Make Your Presentations Accessible to All](/teach-advocate/accessible-presentations/).
